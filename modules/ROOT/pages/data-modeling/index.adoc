Data modeling is a practice that creates structure to a dataset by defining relationships and access routes.
It is an important step to take when using graph databases, as it helps ensuring data integrity and improved performance.

This page contains an introduction to graph data modeling and how to get started with it.

== Graph data model = whiteboard-friendly

Graph data models are often referred as being _whiteboard-friendly_.
Typically, when designing a non-graph data model, people draw and connect example data on the whiteboard to show how different items relate.
This is then re-formatted and structured to fit normalized tables for a relational model.

A similar process exists in graph data modeling too.
However, instead of adapting the data model to a normalized table structure, the graph data model stays the same.
Take this example using data about the movie "The Matrix":

.Matrix - whiteboard model

To fit this data into a graph database and use xref:cypher.adoc[Cypher] as a query language, these entities need to be turned into nodes and their connections, into relationships:

.Matrix - match node and relationship format of property graph model

The next step is to add labels and determine properties for the nodes and relationships.
This helps differentiate entities and thus make it easier to retrieve them from the database:

.Matrix - add labels and properties

Finally, you can view this data model in Neo4j Browser and ensure it matches what was drawn on the whiteboard.
Also, notice how it is nearly identical to the whiteboard model we initially designed.

The ability to easily whiteboard your data model makes the graph data model incredibly simple and visual.
There is no need to draw up business model versions or explain ERD terms to business users.
Instead, the graph data model can be understood by anyone.

// * Data Importer - right now as a part of Aura
// * Cypher Workbench (???)

== How to create a graph data model

To start, _Graph Modeling Guidelines_ introduces the basic process of designing a graph data model and walks you through the first steps to create a graph data model, building upon the foundations of the property graph data model.

It helps you determine the questions you need to ask and share design considerations, best practices learned from experts through the years, and tips for building a more flexible and clean data model to structure your data model for the best results.

[#rdbms-graph-schema]
== Translating an RDBMS schema to graph

If you want to relate your existing knowledge of relational data models to the graph data model or to convert an existing relational model to graph, next section helps you translate that existing ERD skill and design to a graph data model.

From typical process steps to conversion mappings, we will walk through how the process can differ and what tables and columns look like as a graph.

[#optimize-graph-model]
== Optimizing graph data models

Finally, your data model may be working, but you find that query performance or other aspects are not giving you the quality you desired.
The data model can affect queries and performance of your use case.

Learn how to improve your graph solution and maximize the capabilities of what is existing with recommendations for optimization techniques and ideas.

== Live graph models - GraphGists

If you look for graph data model examples or ideas, go to our Neo4j GraphGists, where the Neo4j Community share examples of their solutions.
Based on your use case or industry, you can find some projects that could aid your design process.

Visit our link:https://neo4j.com/graphgists/[GraphGists page^] and explore a rich variety of examples the Neo4j user community created! They are valuable and help developers and others by showing real-life solutions.
